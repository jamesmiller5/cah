Stories: Picked from backlog for this sprint by Developers & Team Leader
===============================================================================
* As a developer I want to create client & server integration-tests so I can assure my code works correctly on the phone & server

Tasks: Created from stories by Developers who also chose what to be completed

* Setup Integration-Test for both Server and Client

* Scale card font size correctly so the text doesn't run out of the cards.
* Scale the game board so that it doesn't get overlapped by the cards for all devices.
